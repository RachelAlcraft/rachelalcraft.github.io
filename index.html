<h2>Protein Structure Utility - Birkbeck MSc</h2>
<p>This website and database was developed as part of an MSc thesis in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (2020), supervisor <a href="http://people.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/~ubcg66a/">Mark Williams</a><br/>
The database contains 3434 high resolution structures with resolution <= 1.3Å and 2697 structures from 2019 > 1.3Å<br/>
The website allows production of geometric plots and statistical analyses using these structures and selected criteria. <br/>
A highlight is the demonstration of the <a href="PsuBirkbeck/examples/bimodaltau.html">bimodal nature of tau.</a></br></br>

<h2>PsuGeometry</h2>
<p>This is a python library to produce geoemntric analyses of protein structures, including the 
secondary structure information from dssp and the electron density information from ccp4 files where available.
The images produced range from a simple Ramachandran plot than can be coloured on for example secondary structure, 
electron density or B-Factor, to say, a correlation of number of electrons against B-Factor.
The library contains some pre-defined reports so the code to create some fairly involved reports is minimal.<br/><br/>
PsuGeometry help and documentation is <a href="psugeometry.html">here</a></br>
</p>
<p>Some examples produced by the library are below:
<ul>
<li><a href="PsuGeometry/examples/PSU-1tt8_rae-GEO.html">Correlation reports</a></li>
<li><a href="PsuGeometry/examples/PSU-tau-GEO.html">Bimodal Tau example for each amino acid individually</a></li>
<li><a href="PsuGeometry/examples/PSU-2cnq_bad-GEO.html">Correlation reports show structure with suspicious geoemtry</a></li>
<li><a href="PsuGeometry/examples/PSU-2cnq_procheck1-GEO.html">Above structure with reports that match ProCheck</a></li>
<li><a href="PsuGeometry/examples/PSU-1ejg_denpt_1ejg-GEO.html">Looking at the electron density against geoemtry and coordinates part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="PsuGeometry/examples/PSU-5nqo_data_5nqo-GEO.html">Looking at the electron density against geoemtry and coordinates part 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The library relies on these Bioinformatics librararies:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://biopython.org/">BioPython</a> for protein structure coordinates</li>
<li><a href="https://pdb-eda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html">PDB EDA</a> for loading the electron density</li>
<li><a href="https://ssbio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instructions/dssp.html">DSSP</a> for asigning secondary structure</li>
</ul>
</p>
</p>

<h2>PsuDensity</h2>
<p>This is a python library to analyse the electron density of protein structures directly, including the 
ability to calculate the second derivative of the electron density.
The images are produced as planar slices based on 3 given xyz coordinates for a central atom, a linear atom and a planar atom.
The PsuGeometry library is used to create html reports in a consistent format, enabling slices at different sizes and granularity, 
different interpolation methods, derivations as far as the degree of the interpolation, and any combination of Fo and Fc 
(based on an assumption of the underlying matrices as 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc).<br/><br/>

<h2>Density Flight</h2>
<p>
Density Flight is a windows application to view the inside of an electron density matrix. The application 
allows you to navigate around like a flight simulator, viewing atoms, bonds between atoms, 
finding density peaks, rotateing in the space to seek planar atoms.<br/>
The application can currently be downloaded from github and built in Vsiual Studio 2019 (C#)<br/>
It will be available for beta testing shortly on request.<br/><br/>
